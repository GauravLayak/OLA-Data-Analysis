**Project Name: OLA Rides Analysis**

## Project Overview
**SQL**
1. Built and optimized an SQL database for ride bookings, ensuring efficient data retrieval and analysis.
2. Developed 10+ SQL views to analyze ride trends, cancellations, and customer behavior, enhancing decision-making.
3. Identified a 15% higher cancellation rate for customer-initiated cancellations, assisting in churn reduction strategies.
4. Extracted payment trends, revealing UPI as the preferred method for 60% of successful rides.
5. Computed ride distance insights per vehicle type, improving fleet allocation strategies.
6. Analyzed driver performance, identifying a variance of 1.5 stars in Prime Sedan driver ratings for service improvement.
7. Ensured data accuracy in rating analysis by filtering non-numeric values for precise reporting.
